# accelerated-spmv
Sparse Matrix Vector multiplication (SpMV) is an important kernel in both traditional high performance computing and emerging data-intensive applications and deep neural networks after using pruning techniques. The goal of this project is to accelerate SpMV using a variety of parallelization techniques and benchmark them.

## Title
Reorganize codebase and add Experiment 1 documentation

## Description

### Changes
- Moved experiment files into `experiment_1/` directory for better organization
- Updated `experiment_1/Makefile` to use correct paths from subdirectory
- Reformatted `results.txt` as markdown table with performance metrics
- Restructured `OBSERVATIONS.md` with improved markdown formatting and clearer sections
- Added comprehensive `README.md` documenting implementation approaches, environment setup, datasets, and performance analysis

### Motivation
Improves repository readability and maintainability by isolating experiments in separate folders, making it easier to add future experiments while keeping shared resources at the root level.
